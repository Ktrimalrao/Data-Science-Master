    "1.Mean: \n",
    "    The mean is the average of a set of numbers.\n",
    "    To calculate the mean, you add up all the numbers in the set and divide the sum by the total count of numbers.\n",
    "    So, the formula for the mean is:\n",
    "        * mean = (sum of all numbers) / (total count of numbers).\n",

    "    The median is the middle value in a set of numbers when they are arranged in order from least to greatest (or vice versa).\n",
    "    If there is an odd number of values, the median is simply the middle number.\n",
    "    If there is an even number of values, you find the two middle numbers and take their average to get the median\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Mode:\n",
    "    The mode is the value(s) that appear most frequently in a set of numbers. \n",
    "    It represents the number(s) that occur with the highest frequency. \n",
    "    In some cases, a set may have no mode if all the numbers appear equally. \n",
    "    It can also have one mode (if one number occurs most frequently) or \n",
    "    multiple modes (if multiple numbers have the same highest frequency)."

    "    The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. \n",
    "    It gives an idea of how much the values in the dataset vary from one another. \n",

    "    For example, consider the following set of data: 5, 6,7,8,9. \n",

    "    For example, consider the following set of data: 5,6,7,8,9 The mean is 7. \n",
