    "#### Ans.\n",
    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting and serving websites or web applications. Here's an explanation of the differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Infrastructure: In traditional web hosting, websites are hosted on physical servers or dedicated hardware owned and managed by a hosting provider. The resources (CPU, RAM, storage) are allocated to specific servers, and the website is hosted on one of those servers. In contrast, cloud hosting utilizes virtualized infrastructure where the website is hosted on virtual servers that are part of a larger network of interconnected servers, often referred to as a cloud. The resources in cloud hosting are flexible and can be dynamically allocated or scaled based on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: Traditional web hosting typically provides a fixed amount of resources assigned to a specific server. Scaling up or down in terms of resources (such as CPU or RAM) requires manual intervention or upgrading to a higher hosting plan. Cloud hosting, on the other hand, offers scalability by allowing easy scaling of resources. Additional resources can be allocated dynamically in response to increased traffic or workload, ensuring that the website can handle spikes in demand without downtime or performance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Availability and Reliability: Traditional web hosting relies on a single physical server to host the website. If that server experiences hardware failure or maintenance, the website may become unavailable. In cloud hosting, the website is distributed across multiple servers and data centers. This redundancy ensures high availability and reliability, as the website can be served from alternative servers if one server or data center experiences issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cost Structure: Traditional web hosting typically follows a fixed pricing model, where users pay for a predefined set of resources regardless of actual usage. In cloud hosting, users pay for the resources they consume, typically on a pay-as-you-go or usage-based pricing model. This flexible cost structure allows users to scale resources based on demand and pay only for what they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Management and Control: In traditional web hosting, the hosting provider manages the server infrastructure, operating system, and server-level software. Users have limited control over the underlying infrastructure. In cloud hosting, users have more control and flexibility as they can configure and manage their virtual servers, operating systems, and software stacks. This allows for greater customization and control over the hosting environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Maintenance and Updates: Traditional web hosting often requires manual maintenance, updates, and security patches to be applied by the hosting provider or the website owner. In cloud hosting, the cloud provider manages the underlying infrastructure, including hardware maintenance, security updates, and backups. This relieves the website owner from many operational tasks and ensures the infrastructure remains up to date and secure."
