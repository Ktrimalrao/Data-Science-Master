    "\n",
    "2. Linear Independence of Eigenvectors: The matrix must have a set of linearly independent eigenvectors equal to its dimension. In other words, the matrix must have as many linearly independent eigenvectors as its size (n, for an n x n matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "***Proof:***\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a square matrix A of size n x n. To determine whether A is diagonalizable, we need to check the conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Condition 1 - Square Matrix:***\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is straightforward. If A is not a square matrix (i.e., the number of rows is not equal to the number of columns), then it cannot be diagonalized using the Eigen-Decomposition approach. We will assume that A is indeed a square matrix.\n",

    "[c₁λ₁, c₂λ₂, ..., cnλn] * [v₁, v₂, ..., vn] = 0\n",

    "\n",
    "c₁λ₁ = c₂λ₂ = ... = cnλn = 0\n",

    "#### Q9. Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "#### Ans.\n",
    "***Yes,*** a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. In many cases, a square matrix may have multiple sets of linearly independent eigenvectors, each associated with a distinct set of eigenvalues. Let's explore this concept in more detail:\n",

    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues:\n",

    "    \n",
    "In this example, the matrix A has two distinct eigenvalues (2 and 3), and each eigenvalue is associated with its set of eigenvectors. However, the eigenvalue λ₁ = 2 has a multiplicity of 2, indicating that it has two linearly independent eigenvectors (v₁₁ and v₂₁) associated with it. The eigenvalue λ₂ = 3 has only one eigenvector (v₁₂) associated with it."

    "#### Q10. In what ways is the Eigen-Decomposition approach useful in data analysis and machine learning? Discuss at least three specific applications or techniques that rely on Eigen-Decomposition.\n",
    "#### Ans.\n",
    "The Eigen-Decomposition approach is highly valuable in data analysis and machine learning, offering various techniques and applications that leverage the properties of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Here are three specific ways in which Eigen-Decomposition is useful in these fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "***1.Principal Component Analysis (PCA):***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data analysis and machine learning.\n",
    "- Description: PCA utilizes Eigen-Decomposition to identify the principal components (eigenvectors) of a dataset. These principal components represent the directions along which the data varies the most. The eigenvalues associated with these components indicate the proportion of variance in the data explained by each component.\n",
    "- Benefits: PCA reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining as much of the original variance as possible. It is used for feature selection, data compression, noise reduction, and visualization, making it valuable in various applications, including image processing and data preprocessing for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "***2.Spectral Clustering:***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: Spectral clustering is a powerful technique for unsupervised clustering in machine learning and data analysis.\n",
    "- Description: Spectral clustering uses Eigen-Decomposition to create a similarity graph of data points. The Laplacian matrix derived from the graph is then diagonalized, yielding eigenvectors and eigenvalues. By clustering in the eigenvector space, spectral clustering can group data points based on their similarity.\n",
    "- Benefits: Spectral clustering can handle complex data structures and discover non-linear clusters, making it useful in image segmentation, community detection in social networks, and other clustering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "***3.Eigenfaces for Face Recognition:***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: Eigenfaces is a technique used in face recognition systems.\n",
    "- Description: Eigenfaces uses Eigen-Decomposition to analyze and represent faces as linear combinations of eigenfaces (eigenvectors). Each eigenface captures a distinct facial feature or pattern in the dataset. During recognition, a test image is projected onto the eigenface space, and the closest match is identified.\n",
    "- Benefits: Eigenfaces enable robust and efficient face recognition by reducing the dimensionality of face images and capturing important facial features. This technique has applications in security systems, biometrics, and access control."
