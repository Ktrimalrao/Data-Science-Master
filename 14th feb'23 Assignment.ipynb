    "    Multithreading is a threading technique in Python programming to run multiple threads concurrently \n",
    "    by rapidly switching between threads with a CPU help (called context switching).\n",

    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "   i.Resource Sharing: All the threads of a process share its resources such as memory, data, files etc.\n",
    "                    A single application can have different threads within the same address space using resource sharing.\n",
    "  ii.Responsiveness: Program responsiveness allows a program to run even if part of it is blocked using multithreading. \n",
    "                     This can also be done if the process is performing a lengthy operation. \n",
    "  iii.Utilization of Multiprocessor Architecture: In a multiprocessor architecture, each thread can run on a different \n",
    "                    processor in parallel using multithreading. This increases concurrency of the system. \n",
    "                    This is in direct contrast to a single processor system, \n",
    "                    where only one process or thread can run on a processor at a time.\n",
    "  iv.Economy: It is more economical to use threads as they share the process resources. Comparatively, \n",
    "                it is more expensive and time-consuming to create processes as they require more memory and resources.\n",
    "                The overhead for process creation and management is much higher than thread creation and management. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "    i. It needs more careful synchronization.\n",
    "   ii. It can consume a large space of stocks of blocked threads.\n",
    "  iii. It needs support for thread or process.\n",
    "   iv. If a parent process has several threads for proper process functioning, \n",
    "        the child processes should also be multithreaded because they may be required.\n",
    "    v. It imposes context switching overhead.\n"

    "\"\"\"Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    A race condition means that your programs result might depend on the order of execution of the individual steps.\n",
    "    This becomes essential in concurrent programs that can run multiple threads of execution simultaneously\n",
    "    through context switching, and they access a shared resource like a variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A deadlock is a concurrency failure mode where a thread or threads wait for a condition that never occurs.\n",
    "    The result is that the deadlock threads are unable to progress and the program is stuck or frozen and must be terminated forcefully."
