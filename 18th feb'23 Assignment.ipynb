    "\"\"\"Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life ?\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows \n",
    "    different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.\n",
    "    It defines how different components of software systems should interact, \n",
    "    what data can be requested or sent, and how it should be formatted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In real life, APIs are used extensively in various domains. For instance:\n",
    "        \n",
    " 1. Social Media Integration: When you see a \"Login with Facebook\" or \"Share on Twitter\" \n",
    "    button on a website or app, it uses APIs provided by social media platforms to \n",
    "    authenticate users and perform actions on their behalf.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 2. Weather Applications: Use APIs provided by weather servicesto retrievereal-time weather\n",
    "    data, such as temperature, humidity, and forecasts, which are then displayed in the app.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 3. Online Payment Gateways: Payment gateways like PayPal or Stripe provide APIs that allow e-commerce\n",
    "    websites or apps to securely process payments by integrating their payment systems into the application.\n",
    "    \n",
    " 4. Maps and Location Services: Applications like Google Maps use APIs to access location-based \n",
    "    services, including mapping data, geocoding, routing, and real-time traffic information."

    "    Advantages of using APIs:\n",
    " 1. Easy Integration: APIs simplify the process of integrating different software applications, \n",
    "    allowing them to work together smoothly.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Time and Cost Savings: APIs enable developers to leverage existing functionalities and resources,\n",
    "    saving time and reducing development costs.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. Expanded Functionality: APIs provide access to additional features and services, allowing developers \n",
    "    to enhance the functionality of their applications without building everything from scratch.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. Improved User Experience: APIs enable the integration of third-party services, enhancing the user \n",
    "    experience by providing seamless access to various functionalities within a single application.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Disadvantages of using APIs:\n",
    " 1. Dependency on External Systems: APIs rely on external systems or services. If those systems experience\n",
    "    downtime or undergo changes, it can affect the functioning of the dependent applications.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Lack of Control: When using APIs, developers have limited control over the underlying systems or \n",
    "    services.Changes made to the API by the provider may require adjustments in the dependent application.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. Potential Security Risks: APIs can introduce security vulnerabilities if not implemented and managed\n",
    "    properly. Unauthorized access, data breaches, or API misuse can pose risks to the system and user data.\n",
    " \n",
    " 4. Compatibility and Versioning Issues: APIs evolve over time, and new versions may introduce compatibility issues\n",
    "    with existing applications. Developers need to manage versioning and ensure compatibility when integrating APIs."

    "\n",
    "  *  REST is like having a simple conversation between systems over the internet.\n",
    "  *  It uses standard web protocols (URLs and HTTP) that we use every day to browse the internet.\n",
    "  *  It follows a \"request and response\" approach, where one system sends a request for data, and \n",
    "     the other system responds with the requested data.\n",
    "  *  It is lightweight and easy to understand, making it suitable for most applications.\n",
    "     It allows flexibility in how data is requested and sent.\n",

    "  * SOAP is like having a structured and formalized conversation between systems.\n",
    "  * It uses a standardized set of rules & formats for sending messages b/w systems,typically based on XML.\n",
    "  * SOAP can handle complex operations, security features, and other advanced functionalities \n",
